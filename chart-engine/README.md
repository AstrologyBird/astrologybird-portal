# Astrologybird chart engine

Small HTTP service that calculates astrological charts. Licensed **AGPL-3.0**
because it uses the Swiss Ephemeris (Astrodienst AG) under its AGPL licence.

## Endpoints

- `GET /api/places?q=Utrecht&lang=nl` — offline place search with IANA time zone
- `POST /api/chart` — `{ date: "1990-05-15", time: "12:30" | null, lat, lon, timezone?, houseSystem?: "placidus" | "wholeSign" | "koch" | "equal" | "porphyry", name? }`
- `POST /api/relationship` — `{ a: <chart input>, b: <chart input> }` → both charts, synastry (cross-aspects, house overlays) and a midpoint composite

## Accuracy notes

- Planets, nodes, Chiron and Lilith from the Swiss Ephemeris data files in `ephe/` (1800–2399).
- Historical time zones come from `zoneinfo/`, compiled **with** the IANA backzone data,
  so e.g. Dutch births before 1940 use Amsterdam time (+00:19:32 / +00:20). The default
  tz data in browsers and Node merged Amsterdam into Brussels and gets these wrong.
- Placidus near the poles falls back to Porphyry.

## Data and licences
